see detailed information about the network interfaces of the router.
Router # show interfaces [Enter]
Now enter the Configuration level to assign an IP address to the router.
Router# configure terminal OR config t
Use an IP address (eg. 10.128.20.254) and subnet mask 255.255.0.0 for the
values. Then do the following:
Router(config) # interface fa 0/0 OR int f0/0
This will ensure that you are configuring the 0/0 interface since there could be
multiple interfaces with names 0/0, 0/1 …etc.
Router(config‐if ) # ip address (given ip address) (given subnet mask) [Enter]
e.g. ip address 10.128.20.254 255.255.0.0
Router(config‐if ) #no shutdown OR no shut
This will ensure that the ip address configuration is administratively up. i.e. The ip address is being used for routing purpose.
Now, exit from if &amp; config
R1(config-if)#exit
R1(config)#exit
Confirm with
